[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) extensions for [Rhapsody](http://www.rhapsody.com/) for Safari

Install
=======

You need [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) (obviously) and the [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).

1. Dowload the extension files
 * https://github.com/gilles/alfred-rhapsody/raw/master/export/Rhapsody%20pause.alfredextension
 * https://github.com/gilles/alfred-rhapsody/raw/master/export/Rhapsody%20play.alfredextension
 * https://github.com/gilles/alfred-rhapsody/raw/master/export/Rhapsody%20playnext.alfredextension

2. Open the file, Alfred recognizes the extension and installs it.

TODO
====

I don't know how to build the extension so I use Alfred's export. It
does not look complicated, I just need to find the time to do it.

Try to do play/pause in one action
